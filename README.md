# CrapGPF
CrapGPF is a Generally Pathetic Failure (GPF) program that basically takes a question and finds the best answer for it based on simliair words and a database of answers. You can find whatever version you want in the branches. 
## CrapGPF v0.1
This build of CrapGPF contains the core features without in-program training. The data for questions and answers is also very small and should probably be provided by the user for better results. Full release will have more functionality via commands and a larger data set.
